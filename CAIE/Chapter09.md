### data integrity
a requirement for data to be accurate, complete, consistent and up to date.

### data privacy
a requirement for data to be available only to authorised users.

### data security 数据安全
a requirement for data to be available for use when needed, ensures that only
authorised users have access to the system and data can be recovered if lost
or corrupted.

### data protection law
a law that governs how data should be kept private and secure.

### malware 恶意软件
malicious software that has the intention of causing harm to a computer system
or its contents.

### hacking
illegal access to a computer system without the owner’s permission.

### ethical hacking
hacking used to test the security and vulnerability of a computer system.

### phishing
use email to trick the recipient into giving personal data to the malicious
sender.

### pharming
redirect the user to fake website in order to illegally obtain personal data.

### authentication
verification that someone or something is who or what they claim to be.

### firewall 防火墙
hardware or software that monitors and controls incoming and outgoing traffic
between a computer and external network.

### eEncryption 加密
encode data (plaintext) using encryption key to form ciphertext.  Ciphertext
can’t be understood if intercepted.

### decryption 解密
use algorithm with the correct decryption key to covert ciphertext back to
plaintext.

### anti-spyware software
software that detects and removes spyware programs on a computer system.

### authorisation
definition of a user’s access rights to system components.

### validation
a check that data entered is of the correct type and format; it does not
guarantee that data is accurate.

### verification
confirmation that the data received by a system is correct.

### check digit
verification method that calculates an additional digit from the number to
be sent and append it to the number.

### parity byte
verification method used in data transmission. An additional bit is added to
make the number of 1s in the byte odd or even to match the parity. If a byte
with an odd number of 1 bits is received when even parity is used, there is
an error.

### parity block
Parity is calculated horizontally and vertically. A parity byte is created
from the bits produced by the vertical parity check and sent with the data.
The receiver re-checks the parity and identify the position of the incorrect
bit if there is one.

### checksum 校验和
verification method used in data transmission by calculating a number from the
data and transmit it with the data. The receiver repeats the calculation and
compares the result with the value received. If the two are different, there is
an error.
