### embedded system 嵌入式系统
a computer system that only performs specific task built into another device.
Its processor, memory and I/O capability are all dedicated to this task only.

### primary storage 主存储器
also known as Immediate Access Storage (IAS). storage components directly
addressable by the CPU, such as cache, RAM and ROM.

### secondary storage
storage components not directly addressable by the CPU, such as HDD, SSD or
optic disc.

### Random-Access Memory (RAM) 随机存取存储器
volatile memory that can be read from or written to any number of times.

### static RAM (SRAM) 静态RAM
type of RAM chip that does not need refreshing.  Each bit uses flip-flops
consisting of several transistors.  It’s faster and consumes less power, but
is more expensive.

### dynamic RAM (DRAM) 动态RAM
type of RAM chip that needs to be constantly refreshed.  Each bit uses a single
transistor and capacitor.  It’s slower and consumes more power, but is less
expensive.

### memory cache 缓存
high speed memory internal to the CPU chip but is external to processor storing
data about to be needed by the processor.

### read-only memory (ROM) 只读存储器
non-volatile memory that cannot be written to but can be read from any number
of times.

### programmable ROM (PROM) 可编程只读存储器
type of ROM that can be programmed once.

### erasable PROM (EPROM) 可擦除可编程只读存储器
can be programmed several times after erasing with UV light.

### electrically EPROM (EEPROM) 电可擦除可编程只读存储器
can be programmed many times after erasing with electrical signal. It stays in
the circuit while changing content.

### buffer 缓冲区
a temporary storage created for data transmitted from one part of the system to
another which functions as a queue.

### Hard Disk Drive (HDD) 机械硬盘
magnetic storage device that uses spinning disks.

### fragmentation 硬盘碎片
data of the same file being stored on an HDD in non-consecutive sectors.

### Solid-State Drive (SSD) 固态硬盘
storage device that has no moving parts and relies on the movement of electrons.
Can be built from NAND gate or NOR gate.

### optical storage 光学存储
types of storage device that uses laser light to read and write data, such as
CD, DVD and Blu-Ray.

### liquid-crystal display (LCD) 液晶显示
a screen back-lit by light-emitting diodes and with liquid crystal cells
sandwiched between polarisers.

### resistive touch screen 电阻式触摸屏
a flexible surface that causes contact between electrically resistive layers
beneath when touched.

### capacitive touch screen 电容式触摸屏
a rigid surface above a conductive layer that undergoes a change in electrical
state when a finger touches the screen.
