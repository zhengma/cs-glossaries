# 3 Hardware 硬件

## 3.1 Computer and Its Components 计算机及其组件

### embedded system 嵌入式系统

a computer system built into a larger system that only performs specific task
built into another device. Its processor, memory and I/O capability are all
dedicated to this task only.

### primary storage 主存储器

also known as Immediate Access Storage (IAS). storage components directly
addressable by the CPU, such as cache, RAM and ROM.

### secondary storage

storage components not directly addressable by the CPU, such as HDD, SSD or
optic disc.

### Random-Access Memory (RAM) 随机存取存储器

volatile memory that can be read from or written to any number of times.
It stores currently running software and data.

### static RAM (SRAM) 静态RAM

type of RAM that does not need refreshing.  Each bit uses flip-flops
consisting of several transistors.  It’s faster and consumes less power, but
is more expensive.

### dynamic RAM (DRAM) 动态RAM

type of RAM that needs to be constantly refreshed.  Each bit uses a single
transistor and capacitor.  It’s slower and consumes more power, but is less
expensive.

### memory cache 缓存

high speed memory internal to the CPU chip but is external to processor storing
data about to be needed by the processor.

### read-only memory (ROM) 只读存储器

non-volatile memory that cannot be written to but can be read from any number
of times. It stores, for example, the start-up instructions.

### programmable ROM (PROM) 可编程只读存储器

type of ROM that can be programmed once.

### erasable PROM (EPROM) 可擦除可编程只读存储器

type of ROM that can be erased completely with UV light and overwritten
multiple times, but to erase it the chip has to be removed from device.

### electrically EPROM (EEPROM) 电可擦除可编程只读存储器

can be overwritten many times after erasing with electrical signal. It stays in
the circuit while being rewritten.

### buffer 缓冲区

a temporary storage created for data transmitted from one part of the system to
another which functions as a queue.

### Hard Disk Drive (HDD) 机械硬盘

magnetic storage device that uses spinning disks.

### fragmentation 硬盘碎片

data of the same file being stored on an HDD in non-consecutive sectors.

### Solid-State Drive (SSD) 固态硬盘

storage device that has no moving parts and relies on the movement of electrons.
Can be built from NAND gate or NOR gate.

### optical storage 光学存储

types of storage device that uses laser light to read and write data, such as
CD, DVD and Blu-Ray.

### liquid-crystal display (LCD) 液晶显示

a screen back-lit by light-emitting diodes and with liquid crystal cells
sandwiched between polarisers.

### resistive touch screen 电阻式触摸屏

a flexible surface that causes contact between electrically resistive layers
beneath when touched.

### capacitive touch screen 电容式触摸屏

a rigid surface above a conductive layer that undergoes a change in electrical
state when a finger touches the screen.

### sensor 传感器

a hardware device that measures a property and transmits a value to a
controlling computer.

### actuator 执行器

a hardware device that receives a signal from a computer and adjusts the setting
of a controlling device.

### monitor system 监控系统

a system that use sensor to measure and record the condition, but does not
affect the input to the sensor.

### control system 控制系统

a system that use sensor to take input, and use feedback to control the actuator
and affect the input.

## 3.2 Logic Gates and Logic Circuits 逻辑门与逻辑电路

### logic proposition 逻辑命题

a statement that is either TRUE or FALSE.

### problem statement

an informal definition of an outcome which is dependent on one logic proposition
or a combination of two or more logic propositions.

### logic expression 逻辑表达式

logic propositions combined using Boolean operators, which may be equated to a
defined outcome.

### logic gate 逻辑门

a component of a logic circuit that has an operation matching that of a Boolean
operator.

### truth table 真值表

a method of checking the output from a logic circuit. They use all the $2^n$
possible combinations from n binary inputs.
