## 17.1 Encryption, Encryption Protocols and Digital certificates 加密，加密协议与数字证书

### asymmetric key cryptography 非对称加密

encryption that provides better security by using a pair of different keys:
a public key and a private key. Example: RSA.

### public key 公钥

the key used in asymmetrical key cryptography that is published by the recipient.
The sender **encrypts** data with the public key.

### private key 私钥

the key used in asymmetrical key cryptography that is never transmitted anywhere.
It is used to **decrypt** data that was encrypted with its matching public key.

### Digital Certificate 数字证书

an electronic document used to authenticate the online identity of an
individual or organisation behind a website. It is typically issued by a CA,
and contains identifying information and a public key.
